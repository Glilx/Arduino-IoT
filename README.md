***electrical circuit consisting of 2 Arduinos connected to each other, one of which (Arduino2) is a transmitter connected to the button, and the other(Arduino1) is a receiver connected to the LED.***

*When we start simulating the circuit by clicking the button the LED lights up👇, when we press the button again the LED turns off👏*
